# Responsive Multipage Dashboard Template

## About

This project is a **responsive multipage dashboard template** created using **HTML5** and **CSS3**, following a **mobile-first approach**. The purpose of this project is to practice building flexible layouts and explore the concepts behind CSS frameworks. Instead of using a pre-built framework like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS, it includes a **manually constructed CSS framework** on a suitable scale, with utility classes, grid systems, and reusable components built from scratch.
